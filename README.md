# copy-dir
This will copy a directory except for node_modules and the .git folder. This speeds up copy/pasting between projects tremendously

## Setup
- Clone this repo
- Symbolically link this script to your path
`ln -s <input-file> <new-symbolic-link>`
  - e.g. `ln -s copy-dir /usr/local/bin/copy-dir`
- Now you should be able to run the script anywhere
